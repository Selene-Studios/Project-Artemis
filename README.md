# Project-Artemis

What is Project Artemis:
Stepping into the future through the shoes of a modern Astronaut on the Artemis mission we will use VR to give new perspective to the realities of their lives in space. 
As many similar Experiences have existed the goal is to skate the line between game and realism. Escaping the guided tour experience that accompanies most educational 
VR experiences. Embrace the immersion that can be had when you are part of the events unfolding around you.

Premise:
Artemis 1 is an upcoming unmanned test run for a future Moon Base operation. Our goal is to present the player with an emulation of the first four phases of the Artemis 3 
the manned final mission that will follow. The player will go from suiting up to boarding the ship. They will prepare for lift off and experience their first loss of gravity. 
As you gracefully make it out of atmosphere, we will rejoin the mission days later as you approach for landing. All culminating after landing with the goal to explore the 
surfaces landmarks as the team sets up base. 

Gameplay:
With a focus on the STEM fields, (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) each step of the game will be a new opportunity to teach about space exploration. Whether it be 
about suit limitations or advancements as you put one on, or hints as to how many tasks an Astronaut is truly responsible for, we will have you using your hands, eyes, and 
head to keep your wits about you as we make you handle the ship’s controls to progress throughout the journey. All this, while dealing with shifting environments as you learn 
to navigate in both zero, and the moon’s gravity. 

Technical Features:
To achieve our goals, we will be aiming for an entirely diegetic experience as the player uses their own hands to interact with the world around them. 

From room scale experiences placed within your own play space to varying navigation schemes as the gravity changes. We will have everything from hand-based navigation using 
hand holds and force in zero gravity, to free locomotion or teleportation while on the moon as we aim to keep the experience comfortable for everyone.
